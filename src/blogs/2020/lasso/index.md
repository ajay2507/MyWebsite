## Why this post?

Creating a High-Performance Javascript app is our high priority. We need module bundler tools like Webpack, browserify, Lasso, etc. In order to achieve this, we will be using Lasso as our module bundler. If you are new to Lasso js, you can check out the documentation.Â 
In most websites, these module bundlers are used to ship the code to the browsers very carefully after minification and bundling.
